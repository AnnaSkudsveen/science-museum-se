# Science Museum website- Semester Exam

### Description
The aim with this project was to create a website for children interested in museum visits, doubling as an educational resource for teachers. The design, featuring vibrant colors and a whimsical vibe, catered to 7â€“14-year-olds. The website has a main, exhibitions, events, and contact page, as well as a detail event, detail exhibit and one article page.

The website is made using only HTML and CSS, and I look forward to develop it further with Javascript.
